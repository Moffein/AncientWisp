Adds the unfinished Ancient Wisp boss into the game.
It's an 1000 credit boss (slightly more expensive than Imp Overlords and Magma Worms)
Spawns on Abyssal Depths, Sundered Grove, Sky Meadow, Sulfur Pools (postloop), as well Gilded Coast and Bulwark's Ambry.

Internal bodyname is MoffeinAncientWispBody.

Currently shares the same boss item drop as the Grovetender.
